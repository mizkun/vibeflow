# 次のステップへ / 開発サイクルを開始

Read .vibe/state.yaml to determine the current step and automatically proceed to the next step according to the Vibe Coding workflow. 

This command can be used to:
- Start a new development cycle from the beginning (Step 1: Plan Review)
- Continue to the next step in an ongoing cycle
- Resume after a human checkpoint

If at a human checkpoint, remind the user what needs to be done. Otherwise, delegate to the appropriate subagent for the next step.
