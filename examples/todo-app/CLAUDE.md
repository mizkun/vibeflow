# Vibe Coding Framework - Context-Continuous Development

**Language**: Communicate in Japanese (æ—¥æœ¬èªž) for all interactions.

## Role-Based Development System

This framework implements a role-based development system where each step is executed by a specific role with clearly defined permissions and responsibilities.

## Workflow Steps and Role Assignments

**Note**: For detailed execution instructions for each role, refer to:
- Product Manager: `.vibe/roles/product-manager.md`
- Engineer: `.vibe/roles/engineer.md`
- QA Engineer: `.vibe/roles/qa-engineer.md`

```yaml
workflow:
  step_1_plan_review:
    role: Product Manager
    mission: Review progress against vision/spec and update development plan
    
  step_2_issue_breakdown:
    role: Product Manager  
    mission: Create detailed, implementable issues from plan
    
  step_2a_issue_validation:
    role: Human

  step_3_branch_creation:
    role: Engineer
    mission: Create feature branch for implementation
    
  step_4_test_writing:
    role: Engineer
    mission: Write failing tests first (TDD Red phase)
    
  step_5_implementation:
    role: Engineer
    mission: Write minimal code to pass tests (TDD Green phase)
    
  step_6_refactoring:
    role: Engineer
    mission: Improve code quality while keeping tests green (TDD Refactor phase)
    
  step_6a_code_sanity_check:
    role: QA Engineer
    mission: Run automated quality checks and linting
    
  step_7_acceptance_test:
    role: QA Engineer
    mission: Verify implementation meets requirements
    
  step_7a_runnable_check:
    role: Human
    mission: Manual testing of implemented features
    
  step_8_pull_request:
    role: Engineer
    mission: Create PR with comprehensive documentation
    
  step_9_review:
    role: QA Engineer
    mission: Code review and quality assessment
    
  step_10_merge:
    role: Engineer
    mission: Merge approved changes to main branch
    
  step_11_deployment:
    role: Engineer
    mission: Deploy to production environment
```

## Workflow Execution Protocol

For each step execution:

1. **Load State**: Read `.vibe/state.yaml` to understand current position
2. **Declare Role Transition**: Explicitly announce role change
3. **Enforce Permissions**: Only access files allowed for current role
4. **Update State**: Record progress in `.vibe/state.yaml`

### Role Transition Declaration Format
```
========================================
ðŸ”„ ROLE TRANSITION
Previous Step: [step_name] ([previous_role])
Current Step:  [step_name] ([current_role])
Issue:         [current_issue]
Now operating as: [CURRENT_ROLE]
Must read: [list of mandatory files]
Can modify: [list of editable files]
========================================
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Context Continuity**: All work executed in main context for information preservation
2. **TDD Enforcement**: Tests must be written before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
3. **File Verification**: Verify artifacts exist before proceeding to next step
4. **Human Checkpoints**: Only at step 2a (issue validation) and 7a (manual testing)
5. **Permission Enforcement**: Strictly follow role-based file access permissions
6. **State Management**: Always update state.yaml after completing each step

## Available Commands

- `/next` - Proceed to next step with role transition
- `/progress` - Check current progress and role status
- `/healthcheck` - Verify repository consistency
- `/quickfix` - Enter quick fix mode for minor adjustments
- `/exit-quickfix` - Exit quick fix mode
- `/parallel-test` - Run tests in parallel

## Quick Fix Mode

A streamlined mode for minor changes outside the normal workflow:
- **Execution**: Runs in main context with relaxed permissions
- **Allowed Changes**: UI styling, typo fixes, small bug fixes
- **Restrictions**: <5 files, <50 lines total changes

## State Management Structure

`.vibe/state.yaml` structure:
```yaml
current_cycle: 1
current_step: 1_plan_review
current_issue: null
current_role: "Product Manager"
last_role_transition: null
last_completed_step: null
next_step: 2_issue_breakdown

# Human checkpoint status
checkpoint_status:
  2a_issue_validation: pending
  7a_runnable_check: pending

# Issues tracking
issues_created: []
issues_completed: []

# Quick fixes tracking
quick_fixes: []
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Role Immersion**: Fully embody the current role's perspective
2. **Permission Compliance**: Strictly adhere to file access permissions
3. **Context Inheritance**: Ensure outputs from previous steps are utilized
4. **Explicit Transitions**: Always declare role changes clearly
5. **Quality Focus**: Each role ensures quality within their domain
